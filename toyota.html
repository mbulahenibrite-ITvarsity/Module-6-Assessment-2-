                <h2>TOYOTA | COROLLA XSE</h2>
                <h2>FIND YOUR NEXT CAR AT AUTO4SALE GARAGE AT GLENVISTA</h2>
                <p>Toyota shook up the midsize sedan segment with the new Camry, and now the 2020 Corolla follows suit. Corolla looks better in every respect than it ever has. The design team called its working concept “shooting robust,” because they were shooting for a robust, confidence-inspiring look.</p>
                
                <p>The bold front fascia with a body-color chin spoiler and aero stabilizing fins emphasize the wide stance, and triple J-shaped LED lights along with LED turn signals have a distinct nighttime signature.</p>
                <p>The rear leaves a distinct impression as well with LED lighting and smoked lenses. Holding it all together are 18-inch wheels that look fantastic, made with a complex machining technique and featuring dark accents.</p>

                <p>Under the hood is a powerful 2.0-liter Dynamic-Force four-cylinder engine which delivers more performance while using less fuel. The new engine features VVT-iE intelligent variable valve-timing on the intake side and VVT-i on the exhaust. VVT-iE uses an electric motor instead of oil pressure to control the variable valve timing.</p>
                
                <p>All of those technologies, along with ultra-low internal friction, yield a maximum thermal efficiency of 40 percent, very high for a vehicle engine. 169 HP and 151 lb.-ft peak torque move the Corolla quickly and smoothly thanks to the CVT.</p>
                
                <p>The new Dynamic-Shift CVT combines the smooth, fuel-efficient performance of a CVT with a more direct driving feel of a traditional geared automatic. The key to its distinct feel is a physical first gear used for start-off acceleration, before handing off to the CVT’s pulley system.</p>
                
                <p>Because the launch gear is handling the higher input load at launch, the size of the CVT’s belt and pulley components were reduced, yielding shifting speeds that are 20 percent faster than in a conventional CVT.</p>
                
               <p>The CVT simulates 10-speed steps along with Sport Mode. Synchronization of the increasing engine revs and vehicle speed gives a linear acceleration feel. Brake Hold is a welcome feature at stoplights that releases once the accelerator is pressed, and we like how the electronic parking brake engages automatically when the Corolla is parked.</p>
