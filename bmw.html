                <h2>BMW 3 SERIES SALOON | G20</h2>
                <h2>FIND YOUR NEXT CAR AT AUTO4SALE GARAGE AT GLENVISTA</h2>
                <p>As you’d expect, with the Bavarians are keen not to upset the design apple cart; it’s instantly identifiable as a 3-series, and although the styling needed to move on, as insiders have repeatedly admitted, it’s pretty much business as usual.</p>
                <p>What helps in this department is the highly flexible new architecture known as CLAR - short for Munich’s ‘Cluster Architecture,’ which now forms the backbone of all future rear-wheel drive BMWs. There have been some notable tweaks to the 3-Series’ dimensions – new car is 85mm longer (4709mm), 16mm wider (1827mm) and all-but identical in terms of height.</p>
                <p>The most notable change is that the wheelbase has grown by 41mm (to 2851mm), which should benefit the rear legroom – traditionally a 3-series weakness. These tweaks don’t make a massive difference, but subtly sportify the car’s overall stance.</p>
                <p>The new 3-series also gets a widened track front and rear track, while increased body torsional rigidity (up by 25%) and uprated suspension mountings are all bound to improve dynamics. Most importantly, the new 3-series is up to 55kg less than its predecessor. Aerodynamics are massively improved, too, with the drag coefficient falling from 0.26 to a Mercedes-Benz-rivalling 0.23. So, expect tighter handling, a higher maximum speed and more efficient motorway cruising.</p>
