                <h2>MERCEDEZ BENZ | C63 AMG COUPE</h2>
                <h2>FIND YOUR NEXT CAR AT AUTO4SALE GARAGE AT GLENVISTA</h2>
                <p>It's getting harder to find a car in the compact-luxury class with ridiculous levels of performance. So we should all be happy for the existence of the 2020 Mercedes-AMG C63, the hot-rod version of the Mercedes-Benz C-class. It's available as a sedan, coupe, or convertible, and every one of them comes with a twin-turbocharged V-8 engine hand-built by engineers in Affalterbach, Germany. The regular C63 makes 469 horsepower, while the C63 S is tuned to make 503 hp. Either way, this car gathers speed in gobs and promises to bring excitement to your humdrum commute. We could do without the harsh ride, but the C63 is so much fun you might not care.</p>
               
                <p>There are a few equipment changes on the 2020 Mercedes-AMG C63. Sedans and coupes now have keyless access and hands-free trunklid control as standard. All 2020 C63 convertibles come with the Aircap feature, which uses deflectors to keep the open-air cockpit warm or cool, and power-folding sideview mirrors. Iridium Silver Metallic is a new exterior color.</p>


               <p>The 2020 Mercedes-AMG C63 and C63 S have a hand-built, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 engine. In the C63, it makes 469 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. The C63 S ups the performance ante with 503 horsepower and 516 lb-ft. Both engines use a nine-speed automatic with rear-wheel drive. Top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph on the regular C63 and 180 mph on the S. In our testing, the C63 S went from zero to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds and ripped through the quarter-mile in 11.9 seconds at 122 mph; we haven't tested a C63. In Lightning Lap 2019, a C63 S coupe turned in a 2:57.1 lap, which puts it right behind the discontinued Cadillac CTS-Von our all-time list. All C63s come standard with an electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential and an AMG Ride Control suspension with adaptive dampers. Dynamic engine mounts are included on C63 S variants.</p>
